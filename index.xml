      <description>&lt;p&gt;Golf is often viewed as a leisurely sport, a relaxing way to spend an afternoon on a manicured course, far from the hustle and bustle of daily life.

Whether it’s an errant golf ball striking someone, an accident with a golf cart, or a player’s slip and fall, these incidents can result in substantial costs, both physical and financial. That’s where insurance comes into play. The right coverage can mitigate these risks and provide peace of mind for golfers, course operators, and spectators alike.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
